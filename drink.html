            Asbach Uralt is a German brandy created in Cologne by Hugo Asbach in 1892.
            Asbach started his brandy distilling career after learning the craft in France, creating what is today known as ‘Weinbrand’ (wine brandy).
            Traditional Asbach Uralt is an amber-coloured brandy with faint tastes of honey, coffee and vanilla, as well as a sweet peppery overtone that makes Asbach Uralt stand out from other German liqueurs.
            Best served on ice, Asbach Uralt comes in various flavours and styles, including an aged version.
