          It is a dish that is usually served when visiting grandparents or on
          special occasions. To prepare this dish, you need a quality piece of
          meat and a lot of time. The meat should be put in the oven to slowly
          cook in its own water for hours. Slow cooking meat with low flame
          makes it soft and delicious.

          If you want to cook Rouladen yourself,
           be sure to go to a butcher and ask them for meat prepared 
           for Rouladen, so that the extra trouble of preparing the 
           meat will be removed from you. If you want to prepare the 
           meat yourself, you will need some thin slices of beef. We 
           fill the inside of the meat with mustard, onions and pickles,
           roll it up and put it in the oven to cook in its sauce for a
           few hours. It takes a lot of time to prepare this delicious
           dish, so we suggest you try it in one of the German
           restaurants.

        <span>
          Locals say that Gulasch is not a German dish,
          but Germans love it nonetheless. Maybe they took
          the original recipe and changed it to their own
          taste. To prepare goulash, thin slices of beef
          should be placed in a thick sauce and put in 
          the oven to cook slowly. This cooking method
          makes the meat soft and tender. Goulash can
          be served as a soup or with side dishes such as spaetzle.
