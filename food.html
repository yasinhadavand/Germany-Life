          It is a dish that is usually served when visiting grandparents or on
          special occasions. To prepare this dish, you need a quality piece of
          meat and a lot of time. The meat should be put in the oven to slowly
          cook in its own water for hours. Slow cooking meat with low flame
          makes it soft and delicious.
